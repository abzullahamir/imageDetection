# imageDetection
This project uses stb_image.h to read the pixels and the color channels of 2 pictures and stores them in arrays
the 2 arrays are used to find one as a subscript of the other, using the needle in haystack logic
it implements image detection including scenarios where the target image is rotated, flipped, rotated + flipped in every orientation.
